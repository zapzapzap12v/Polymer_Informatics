## Abstract

This report documents the complete execution of a five-phase polymer informatics pipeline, transitioning from synthetic dataset generation to ANSYS Maxwell 2D finite-element simulation as the primary source of ground-truth capacitance data. A combinatorial library of **1440 unique polymer configurations** was generated from 10 backbone families and systematically simulated. The **551 high-fidelity successes** were used to train a 3-Way Ensemble (MLP + GBR + XGBoost) achieving **R² = 0.9558** (10-Fold CV **0.9073**). The project was then extended with advanced methodologies, including Graph Neural Networks (GNN) achieving **R² = 0.9528** (5-Fold CV **0.9301**), a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) for generative discovery, and Multi-Objective Pareto optimization. Finally, Virtual High-Throughput Screening across 25,000 configurations successfully identified polymer candidates hitting an industrial target of **200 pF/m** with sub-0.1% error.

## Section 2: Phase 1 — ANSYS Maxwell 2D Simulation Campaign

### 2.1 Combinatorial SMILES Generation

A systematic combinatorial approach was used to generate the simulation library. Starting from **10 polymer backbone families** (PE, PP, PVC, PTFE, PVDF, Polystyrene, PMMA, Polycarbonate, PET, Nylon-6), each backbone was mutated with **9 left-groups** and **8 right-groups** from a curated set of chemically realistic functional groups, producing a library of 1440 unique configurations validated with RDKit.



### 2.2 Simulation Configuration

Each simulation was executed as an ANSYS Maxwell 2D Electrostatic thin-film capacitor:

- **Geometry:** Parallel-plate capacitor (inner plate = polymer dielectric, outer = vacuum boundary)

- **Material Model:** Permittivity injected dynamically per sample from the material database

- **Solver:** ElectroStatic (Electrostatic solver) with adaptive mesh refinement

- **Session Architecture:** Memory-safe restarts every 50 samples (Student version constraint)



### 2.3 Simulation Outcome Summary



| Outcome | Count | Percentage |

|---|---|---|

| Simulation Success | 551 | 38.3% |

| Solver Failed | 889 | 61.7% |

| Failed Extraction | 0 | 0.0% |

| **Total Simulated** | **1440** | 100% |



> **Note:** Failed simulations arise from mesh singularities in extremely thin films (< 400 nm) where the Student Version solver encounters memory limits. These are excluded from ML training rather than interpolated, ensuring physical integrity of the dataset.

---

## Section 3: Phase 2 — Machine Learning Training

### 3.1 Feature Engineering

The 518-column feature matrix was constructed from two groups:

- **Morgan Fingerprints (512 bits):** Circular fingerprints (radius=2) computed from each SMILES string using RDKit, encoding the structural identity of the polymer chain.

- **Physical Properties (6 features):** `dielectric_constant`, `tg_celsius`, `density_g_cm3`, `thickness_nm`, `applied_voltage`, `temp_c` — all directly from the simulation manifest.

Morgan bits were compressed to 64 principal components via PCA before ensemble training.



### 3.2 Ensemble Architecture

A 3-Way `VotingRegressor` ensemble was trained on the 551 verified samples (80/20 split):

- **MLP** (128, 64, 32): Adaptive LR, 200-iter patience, L2=0.01, weight=0.35

- **GBR** (300 estimators, depth=4, subsample=0.8): weight=0.35

- **XGBoost** (300 estimators, depth=4, colsample=0.8): weight=0.30



### 3.3 Model Performance



| Model | R² (Test) | MAE (pF/m) | RMSE (pF/m) |

|---|---|---|---|

| MLP Stand-alone | 0.8269 | 35.30 | 52.14 |

| **3-Way Ensemble** | **0.9558** | **14.68** | **26.36** |

| 10-Fold Cross-Validation | **0.9073 ± 0.0614** | — | — |



The improvement from MLP alone (R²=0.8269) to the Ensemble (R²=0.9558) confirms that the gradient boosting algorithms (GBR and XGBoost) are successfully capturing the non-linear relationship between film thickness, permittivity, and capacitance.

## Section 5: Phase 3 — Inverse Design Results

### 5.1 Methodology: Virtual High-Throughput Screening (vHTS)

Rather than gradient-based optimization (which requires a differentiable model), we employed **Virtual High-Throughput Screening** — generating a random library of 25,000 polymer configurations and evaluating all of them in parallel using the trained ensemble. The objective function minimized was: `Error = |Predicted Capacitance - Target Capacitance|`



### 5.2 Target: 200 pF/m (Industrial EV-Grade)

The 200 pF/m target represents a **5-10x improvement over current commercial BOPP** (~20-35 pF/m), making it directly applicable to next-generation EV inverter film capacitors where miniaturization is a key design constraint.

Of the 551 ANSYS-verified polymers, **125 (22.7%) meet or exceed the industrial EV-grade threshold** of 200 pF/m, representing immediately actionable candidates for experimental synthesis.

## Section 8: Conclusion

This pipeline has demonstrated a complete, end-to-end **computational materials discovery workflow**: starting from molecular SMILES generation, through FEA physics simulation (ANSYS Maxwell 2D), to machine learning ensemble training and physics-guided inverse design. The key contributions are:



1. **1440 unique polymer mutants** synthesized combinatorially from 10 backbone families.
